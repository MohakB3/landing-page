        <div class="Block">Welcome!</div>

        <div class="Main_Body"><p>Welcome! This is my landing page. This page is part of my first Programming 11 assignment and will store all of my assignments in the Projects page. Other than the neccecary evils, this webpage doesn't really have much of a purpose and in-fact, is not hosted anywhere and can only be accessed locally. If this website were to be hosted, it most likely wouldn't be very safe because I am not an expert in cybersecurity unlike certain people so, that's that. I don't know what else to write here and I'm mainly just trying to fill this paragraph out as much as possible because it's part of the assignment. Is this enough yet? Currently we are at 117 words which is fine I think because the totality of the website has to have 300 words which it probabally will because the minor amounts of text scattered around.Also I forgot to mention that the the resources page will most likely have a bunch of resources that are really handy to design and make websites, like hex pickers and google fonts etc. so that's also nice, I guess. Are we there yet? I'm tired of writing. Ok so I checked google docs and apparantly we're still under 300 words but at this point, whatever. Actually a cool thing to make in this course might be a word counter so I don't have to go to google docs every 5 seconds to check. Also another great idea would be to try to integrate all the tools like hex pickers and stuff into this website. Honestly writing rando stuff is actually a decent way of conming up with ideas so thats cool too. I also just realized that I'm rambling so you know what, while I'm on this rambling stage, I might as well write out my life story. Actually my entire life story might be a bit too much so I'm just gonna express life's current problems. I think that I didn't spend enough effort last semester which meant that my marks- and okay I just realized that we're past the 300 mark so there's no need. I might go further into my life story in about me though!</p></div>
